        I have 4 years of experience in 3d modelling in blender and 2 year experience in substance painter for texturing. 
        I have worked several freelance jobs as a 3d artist making different types of game ready assets, ranging from environment to weapons to airplanes.
        Currently I am working as the lead artist for Rank up Games LLC for an upcoming mobile game War In Arms.
